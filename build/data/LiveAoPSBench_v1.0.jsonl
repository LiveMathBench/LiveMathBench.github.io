Cat asks Claire if it is possible that Claire's number is a multiple of Cat's number. Claire responds that her number is not a multiple of Cat's number, but it is not a prime number. Claire also mentions that even if she were to reveal the two digits of her number, Cat would still not be able to determine her number. Cat then deduces that their numbers are not relatively prime. Claire concludes that their numbers must share the same ones digit. What is the product of Cat and Claire\u2019s numbers?", "post_time": {"month": 11, "year": 2024}, "answers": ["1316"]}
